"""
Define a class named InventoryManager.

Implement methods in the class to add products, remove products, update quantities

Create a method to retrieve product information by providing a product_name parameter. If the product with the given name exists in the inventory, call the corresponding method of the Product object to retrieve its information; otherwise, return a "Product not found" message.

Implement a method called get_total_inventory_value to calculate the total value of the entire inventory. This method should allow you to determine the total worth of the inventory by summing up the individual values of each product based on its price and quantity.
